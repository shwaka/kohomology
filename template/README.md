This directory serves as a template project to use kohomology.

## Usage
1. You need to install JDK. See [Quick start](https://shwaka.github.io/kohomology/docs/quick-start) for details.
2. Run `runner.bat` (Windows) or `runner.sh` (Mac, Linux).
    - [Windows] Double-click `runner.bat` or run it from command prompt.
    - [Mac, Linux] Run `runner.sh` from your terminal.

## Notes
- `runner.bat` (resp. `runner.sh`) is just a wrapper for `gradlew.bat run` (resp. `./gradlew run`).
  So you can run `gradlew.bat` (resp. `gradlew`) directly if you like.
