import { ImportKotlin } from '@site/src/components/ImportKotlin';

Here is an example script computing the cohomology of
the free loop space of the even dimensional sphere.

First we define the Sullivan model of the even dimensional sphere as in the [previous page](./sullivan-algebra.mdx).

<ImportKotlin path="FreeLoopSpace.kt" restrict="sphere" />

By using the Sullivan model `sphere`,
the model of the free loop space is obtained by `FreeLoopSpace(sphere)`.

<ImportKotlin path="FreeLoopSpace.kt" restrict="freeLoopSpace" />

It is just a special example of `FreeDGAlgebra`,
so we can apply any computation methods to it. (See the [previous page](./sullivan-algebra.mdx) for details.)

<ImportKotlin path="FreeLoopSpace.kt" restrict="computation" />


## With MultiDegree
In general, the Sullivan model $(\Lambda V\otimes\Lambda\overline{V}, d)$ of a free loop space
has a decomposition
$(\Lambda V\otimes\Lambda\overline{V}, d) \cong \bigoplus_k(\Lambda V\otimes\Lambda^k\overline{V}, d)$
as *complexses*.
By using this fact, its cohomology can be computed very quickly.
We can use this feature by replacing
`FreeLoopSpace(sphere)` with `FreeLoopSpace.withShiftDegree(sphere)` as follows.

<ImportKotlin path="FreeLoopSpace.kt" restrict="freeLoopSpaceWithMultiDegree" />

See [this page](./multi-degree.mdx) for details on `MultiDegree`.
