import { ImportKotlin } from '@site/src/components/ImportKotlin';

Here is an example script computing the cohomology of
the free loop space of the even dimensional sphere.

By using a Sullivan model `sphere` of the sphere,
the model of the free loop space is obtained by `FreeLoopSpace(sphere)`.
It is just a special example of `FreeDGAlgebra`,
we can apply any computation methods to it. (See the [previous page](./sullivan-algebra.mdx) for details.)
