In this tutorial, we give some example usages of the library `kohomology`.
See also tests in [jvmTest](https://github.com/shwaka/kohomology/tree/main/kohomology/src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/github/shwaka/kohomology) for more examples.

You can find complete examples in [shwaka/kohomology-app](https://github.com/shwaka/kohomology-app).
Auto-generated documentation can be seen [here](https://shwaka.github.io/kohomology/dokka/index.html) (but currently very few descriptions are given).
