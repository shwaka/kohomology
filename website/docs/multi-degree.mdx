Using `MultiDegree`, you can efficiently compute cohomology of some Sullivan algebras.

## Mathematical explanation
Usually, Sullivan algebras are $\Z$-graded.
But, in some case, the grading can be extended to a larger group.

For example, the Sullivan model $(\wedge(x,y), d)$ of the even dimensional sphere $S^{2n}$
can be $(\Z\oplus\Z)$-graded since it has $n$ as a "parameter".
More precisely,
the degrees $|x|=2n$ and $|y|=4n-1$ can be considered as elements of
$\Z\oplus\Z=\Z\{1,n\}$ (i.e. $\{1, n\}$ is the basis of $\Z\oplus\Z$).

`kohomology` supports computation of cohomology with
$(\Z\oplus\Z)$-grading (or $(\Z\oplus\cdots\oplus\Z)$-grading),
which is faster than the usual one.


## Usage
First you need to define `degreeGroup`.
<ImportKotlin path="MultiDegree.kt" restrict="degree" />

Then you can define a Sullivan algebra using the above `degreeGroup`.
<ImportKotlin path="MultiDegree.kt" restrict="model" />

Its cohomology can be computed as follows:

<ImportKotlin path="MultiDegree.kt" restrict="cohomology" />

## Performance
If applicable, computations with `MultiDegree` are much faster than those with `IntDegree` (usual $\Z$-grading).
[This page](./free-loop-space.mdx) contains benchmark for the case of the free loop space of $S^2$.
