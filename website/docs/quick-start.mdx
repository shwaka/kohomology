`kohomology` is a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) library published at the maven repository [shwaka/maven](https://github.com/shwaka/maven).
You can use it in any kotlin project.

## Requirement
You need to install Java Development Kit (JDK).
Here we give an example of installation, but most JDK distributions and versions should be OK.

- [Windows] Install from [Amazon Corretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html). Usually you will choose [amazon-corretto-8-x64-windows-jdk.msi](https://corretto.aws/downloads/latest/amazon-corretto-8-x64-windows-jdk.msi)
- [Mac, Linux] First, install [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/). Then run `sdk install java 8.292.10.1-amzn`.

## How to start?
There are several ways to use `kohomology`.

### Start from a template project (recommended)
The directory [kohomology/template](https://github.com/shwaka/kohomology/tree/main/template) serves as a template project to use kohomology.
If you are not familiar with kotlin projects, this is a good starting point.
See [its README.md](https://github.com/shwaka/kohomology/blob/main/template/README.md) for detailed usage.

### Start from a new Kotlin project
Create a gradle project as in [Get started with Kotlin/JVM | Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-get-started.html)
(or use an existing gradle project).
Then write the following in your `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`):

import { BuildGradleDocument } from "@site/src/components/BuildGradleDocument";

<BuildGradleDocument/>

### Try online (easiest)
You can try `kohomology` online at [Calculator](/calculator).
This is the easiest way since no installation is required,
but the online calculator has some disadvantages to the above methods:
- It contains very restricted features of `kohomology`.
- It is much slower.

### Introduction to Kotlin
- The [official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) is well-written and is a good starting point.
- We (and the Kotlin official team) strongly recommend to use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux)
  to edit Kotlin source codes.
