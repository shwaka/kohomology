[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) can also handle Sullivan algebras, as documented in [this page](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/commutative_dga.html).
In this document, we compare it with `kohomology`.

## Advantages of `kohomology`
- `kohomology` is much faster than `sage`.
  See the section [benchmark](#benchmark) for details.
- `kohomology` has implementations of some specific rational models (of mapping spaces).
  For a 1-connected space $M$, we can get
  $LM$, $ES^1\times_{S^1}LM$ and $\operatorname{Map}([0,1], M)$ easily.
  See [this doc](./free-loop-space.mdx) and tests in [this directory](https://github.com/shwaka/kohomology/tree/main/kohomology/src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/github/shwaka/kohomology/model).
  The Quilllen model of $B\operatorname{aut}_1(M)$ can be computed as in [this test](https://github.com/shwaka/kohomology/blob/main/kohomology/src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/github/shwaka/kohomology/free/DerivationDGLieAlgebraTest.kt).
- In `sage`, the generators of a Sullivan algebra must be sorted by their degrees.
  On the other hand, in `kohomology`,
  they can be sorted in any order
  as long as along the order is compatible with the differential of the Sullivan algebra.
  For example, consider the Sullivan model $\Lambda(x, y, sx, sy)$
  of the free loop space $LS^{2n}$.
  Since $\deg{sx} < \deg{x} < \deg{sy} < \deg{y}$,
  they must be sorted as $(sx, x, sy, y)$ in `sage`.
  But we can sort as $(x, y, sx, sy)$ in `kohomology` and this looks better.
- `kohomology` is implemented by a *statically typed* language `kotlin`.
  So you get much assistance from development tools.

## Advantages of `sage`
- Since computation of Sullivan algebras is a implemented as a part of *huge* system `sage`,
  we can use it together with other parts of `sage`.
- `sage` has some features which are not implemented in `kohomology`,
  including [formality check](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/commutative_dga.html#sage.algebras.commutative_dga.DifferentialGCAlgebra.is_formal) and [computation of minimal models](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/commutative_dga.html#sage.algebras.commutative_dga.DifferentialGCAlgebra.minimal_model).
  These may be implemented in `kohomology` in some future (your contributions are welcome!).


## Benchmark result {#benchmark}
import { ComparisonChart, ShowVersion } from '@site/src/components/ComparisonChart';

Here we give benchmark results of `kohomology` and `sage`.
Note that the source code can be read [here](https://github.com/shwaka/kohomology/tree/main/website/comparison).

The following chart shows the time to compute
$H^k(LS^{2})$ for $0\leq k\leq n$.
The time grows very quickly for `sage`.

<ComparisonChart target="FreeLoopSpaceOf2Sphere" />

Next, the following shows the time to compute $H^k(LS^{2})$ with *multi-grading*.
The time for `sage` is the same as the above,
but the time for `kohomology` is much faster than the above.

<ComparisonChart target="FreeLoopSpaceOf2SphereWithMultiGrading" />

Multi-grading is the same as $\Z^m$-grading,
but its precise definition is different between `kohomology` and `sage`.
Its mathematical definition is given as follows:
- Multi-graded DGA in `kohomology` is nothing but a $\Z^m$-graded DGA,
  i.e. the differential also preserves $\Z^m$-grading.
  Hence its cohomology is also $\Z^m$-graded.
  See [this doc](./multi-degree.mdx) for details.
- Multi-graded DGA in `sage` is a $\Z^m$-graded algebra
  equipped with a differential which only preserves the $\Z$-grading
  given by the total degree (the sum of degrees).
  Hence its cohomology is only $\Z$-graded.
  This is documented in the first paragraph of [this page](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/commutative_dga.html):
  > These algebras can be graded over the integers or
  > they can be multi-graded (i.e., graded over a finite rank free abelian group $\Z^m$);
  > if multi-graded, the total degree is used in the Koszul sign convention,
  > and the differential must have total degree 1.

In `kohomology`,
the computation becomes faster with multi-grading
since $\Z^m$-grading gives a finer decomposition of vector spaces and matrices.
Of course, this is not the case for `sage`.
