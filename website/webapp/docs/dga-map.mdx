## DGA map
Consider the map
$f\colon S^{2n}\times S^{2n}\to S^{4n}$
obtained by collapsing $n$-skeleton of $S^{2n}\times S^{2n}$ to a point.
Its Sullivan representative can be defined as follows.

First we define Sullivan models of $S^{4n}$ and $S^{2n}\times S^{2n}$.
They can be taken as
$(\wedge(x,y), d)$ with $dx=0$ and $dy=x^2$, and
$(\wedge(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2), d)$ with $da_i=0$ and $db_i=a_i^2$, respectively.

<ImportKotlin path="DGAlgebraMap.kt" restrict="model" />

Sullivan representative of the map $f$ is a DGA map
$\varphi\colon\wedge(x,y)\to\wedge(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2)$
given by
$\varphi(x)=a_1a_2$ and $\varphi(y)=a_1^2b_2$.
In kohomology, this can be defined and used as follows:
