In this section, we explain a way to compute cohomology of a Sullivan algebra.

## Define a Sullivan algebra
Consider the minimal Sullivan model of the $2n$-dimensional sphere.
Explicitly it is written as $(\Lambda(x, y), d)$
where the degrees are given by $\deg{x}=2n$ and $\deg{y}=4n-1$, and
the differential is given by $dx=0$ and $dy=x^2$.
You can define it as follows:

<ImportKotlin path="SphereModel.kt" restrict="def" />

Note that `FreeDGAlgebra` is the class for Sullivan algebras.
It is because, ignoring differentials, Sullivan algebras are free as commutative graded algebras.

## Compute cohomology
The cohomology of a `FreeDGAlgebra` can be accessed from the member `cohomology`.

<ImportKotlin path="SphereModel.kt" restrict="cohomology" />

## DGA operations
DGA operations (e.g. sum, multiplication, differential) can be applied within `context.run`.

<ImportKotlin path="SphereModel.kt" restrict="context" />
