Input a Sullivan algebra from the "Edit DGA" button

This calculator can compute the cohomology of the Sullivan algebra, its Hochschild homology (cohomology of the free loop space), and its cyclic homology (equivariant cohomology of the free loop space).

Note that "u" cannot be used as a generator when "cyclic" is selected, since "u" is reserved for the model of the cyclic homology.
